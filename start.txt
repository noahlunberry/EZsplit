Project Overview
Goal: Build a web application that allows you and your friends to easily split grocery bills by:

Scanning Receipts: Use AI-powered Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract itemized data from receipt images.
Assigning Expenses: Provide an intuitive interface to assign specific items to individuals or groups.
Calculating Splits: Automatically calculate who owes what based on the assigned items.
Additional AI Features: Implement features like expense categorization, spending analytics, and predictive suggestions to enhance functionality and impressiveness.
Step-by-Step Guide
1. Plan Your Tech Stack
Frontend:

Framework: React.js – for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
UI Library: Material-UI or Ant Design – to speed up development with pre-built components and maintain a clean design.
Backend:

Runtime Environment: Node.js
Framework: Express.js – for handling server-side logic and API endpoints.
Database:

Database: MongoDB – for flexible and scalable data storage.
ORM/ODM: Mongoose – for easier data modeling and validation.
AI and OCR Services:

OCR: Use cloud-based services like Google Cloud Vision API, Microsoft Azure Computer Vision, or open-source solutions like Tesseract OCR.
Additional AI: Utilize TensorFlow.js for client-side machine learning or Python-based TensorFlow/PyTorch for server-side processing.
Deployment:

Frontend: Netlify or Vercel
Backend: Heroku, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform
2. Implement Receipt Scanning with AI
Step-by-Step:

a. Capture and Upload Receipt Image
Allow users to upload a photo of their receipt via the web app.
Ensure image preprocessing (like cropping and enhancing) for better OCR results.
b. Extract Text Using OCR
Option 1: Google Cloud Vision API

Pros: High accuracy, easy to use, supports receipt parsing.
Cons: Incur costs after free tier, requires internet connection.
Implementation:
Send the uploaded image to the API.
Receive structured data including items, prices, and totals.
Google Cloud Vision API Documentation
Option 2: Microsoft Azure Computer Vision

Similar to Google’s offering with competitive pricing and features.
Azure Computer Vision Documentation
Option 3: Tesseract OCR

Pros: Open-source and free.
Cons: May require more preprocessing for accurate results, complex implementation.
Implementation:
Use libraries like tesseract.js for client-side processing or integrate with Python backend.
Apply image preprocessing techniques (grayscale conversion, noise reduction).
Parse raw text output to extract items and prices.
Tesseract.js Documentation
c. Parse and Organize Extracted Data
Develop algorithms to process OCR output into a structured format:

Items: Name and description.
Prices: Corresponding cost for each item.
Quantities: Number of units purchased.
Handle common OCR errors and ambiguities by implementing validation checks and allowing manual corrections by users.

d. User Interface for Assigning Items
Display the parsed receipt data in a clear and editable format.
Allow users to:
Select Items: Click or tap on items to assign them.
Assign to Individuals or Groups: Choose who is responsible for each item.
Split Items: Support splitting individual items among multiple people (e.g., shared items).
Implementation Tips:
Use interactive UI components like checkboxes, dropdowns, and drag-and-drop features for ease of use.
Provide real-time calculation of owed amounts as assignments are made.
3. Calculate and Manage Payments
a. Calculate Individual Shares
Based on item assignments, compute the total amount each person owes.
Include options for:
Tax and Tip: Distribute additional costs proportionally or equally.
Discounts: Account for any discounts applied to the total bill.
b. Payment Tracking
Keep records of settled and outstanding payments.
Optionally integrate with payment services for seamless transactions:
Payment Integrations:
PayPal API
Stripe API
Venmo API (Note: Venmo has limited API support)
Features:
Send payment requests directly through the app.
Update payment status automatically upon completion.
c. Expense History
Maintain a history of past shopping trips and splits.
Provide summaries and detailed views for transparency and record-keeping.
4. Additional AI Features for Enhanced Functionality
Incorporate extra AI-driven features to make your app more impressive and useful:

a. Expense Categorization
Functionality: Automatically categorize items into groups like groceries, household supplies, etc.
Implementation:
Use pre-trained models or simple keyword matching for categorization.
Enhance with Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.
Libraries like spaCy or NLTK can be helpful for NLP tasks.
b. Spending Analytics
Functionality: Provide insights into spending habits over time.
Features:
Visualizations: Use charts and graphs to display spending breakdowns.
Trends: Identify and highlight spending trends.
Budgeting: Suggest budgets based on past spending patterns.
Implementation:
Utilize charting libraries like Chart.js or D3.js.
Implement algorithms to analyze historical data and derive insights.
c. Predictive Suggestions
Functionality: Suggest items to add to the shopping list based on past purchases and frequency.
Implementation:
Use machine learning models to predict commonly purchased items.
Frameworks like TensorFlow.js allow you to build and run ML models directly in the browser.
Start with simple models (like frequency-based recommendations) and gradually incorporate more complex algorithms (like collaborative filtering).
d. Chatbot Assistance
Functionality: Implement a chatbot to assist with using the app, adding items, and answering queries.
Implementation:
Use services like Dialogflow or Microsoft Bot Framework to build conversational interfaces.
Integrate the chatbot within the app for seamless user experience.
e. Language Translation
Functionality: Automatically translate receipts in different languages to English.
Implementation:
Utilize translation APIs such as Google Translate API or Microsoft Translator Text API.
Combine with OCR to handle international receipts.
f. Currency Conversion
Functionality: Convert expenses in different currencies to a base currency.
Implementation:
Use exchange rate APIs like Fixer or Open Exchange Rates.
Automatically detect currency from receipts and perform conversions.
5. Development Workflow
a. Agile Approach
Sprint Planning: Break down the project into manageable tasks and sprints.
Version Control: Use Git and platforms like GitHub for code management and collaboration.
Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD): Set up pipelines using GitHub Actions or Travis CI for automated testing and deployment.
b. Testing
Unit Testing: Write tests for individual components using frameworks like Jest (for JavaScript).
Integration Testing: Ensure different parts of the app work together seamlessly.
User Testing: Gather feedback from real users (friends and family) to identify usability issues and areas for improvement.
c. Documentation
Maintain thorough documentation of your codebase and APIs.
Create a README file explaining the project's purpose, setup instructions, and usage guides.
Document your learning process and challenges overcome; this can be valuable during interviews.
